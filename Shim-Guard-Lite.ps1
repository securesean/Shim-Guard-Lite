# This program will print out currently installed shims, their locations, install times and will register 
# for events relating to the install of a new Shim Database (SDB files). This program will currently only alert you.
# In future versions, it will attempt to block the shim from executing. 
# This is proof-of-concept so don't hate. Be sure to run this withx64 power shell on x64 systems 
# because the VirtualRegistry fix will redirect the look ups if it's running as 32-bit program (aka WOW64 process)

#Requires â€“version 3.0
